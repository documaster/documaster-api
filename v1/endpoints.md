# Basic concepts

## Supported protocols

The web services support the following protocols:

- HTTPS

## Authentication and authorization

The web services require an access token (Bearer) to be specified in the HTTP headers when sending requests. A token can be obtained from the OpenID Connect Identity Provider used by the Documaster instance.

## HTTP status codes

The following table lists the HTTP status codes used by the web services.

| Status code                | Definition                                                                                                                                         | Example                                                         |

## Path

All endpoints appear under the following base path:

**{baseUrl}/api/v1/{resource}**

## Dates encoding

- Dates must be encoded as **ISO 8601** strings prior to sending them to the web services.
- Dates are returned by the web services as **ISO 8601** formatted strings.

In plain English:
- `timestamp` attributes have to be be in the following format: `2020-01-01T01:01:01.000+01:00`
- `date` attributes have to be be in the following format: `2020-01-01`

```
PUT /{resource}/{id} HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-type: application/json

{
    "data": { attribute: value, ... },
    "update": {
        attribute: [
            { "add": { "id": value } }, ...

    "attributes": [ string, ... ]
}
```

- `data` (optional)
  - contains the resource to be updated

  - attributes that are not specified will not be modified
- `update` (optional)
  - contains a list of (multiple) `add` and/or `remove` actions to be performed on the resources identified by the attribute
  - `add` (optional)
    - operates on collection-based attributes only
    - adds the resource with the specified ID to the collection
    - useful for linking Tags to Sections, for example
    - cannot be used for children of the resource being updated
  - `remove` (optional)
    - operates on collection-based attributes only
    - removed the resource with the specified ID from the collection
    - useful for unlinking Tags from Sections, for example
- `flags` (optional)
  - specifies one or more flags requesting additional information
  - `includeTotal`
    - retrieves the total amount of results
    - incurs a performance cost on the Documaster instance

- `attributes` (optional)
  - specifies the list of attributes to be returned for each resource in the response

At least one of `data` or `update` must be specified in an update request.

The same attribute cannot be updated via both `data` and `update`.

When both `data` and `update` have been specified, the attributes in the `data` element will be set first and the actions specified in `update` will be executed afterwards.

## Search endpoint

Performs search queries in the Documaster index based on a user-defined free-text query. Additional criteria can be specified using a [free-text search query language](free-text-search-query-language.md) to narrow down the results.

Note that the free-text search endpoints differs from the lookup endpoint in the following ways:

1. While the lookup endpoint will always operates on the **latest state** of the resources, the free-text search might not immediately reflect changes performed via the create, update, or delete endpoints. Ask us for more information on the delays when using the free-text search endpoint.

2. The free-text search endpoint allows you to perform non-exact search requests that will be sorted by relevance by default.

3. The full-text search is *likely* to perform better for heavily-filtered query requests.

4. The full-text search endpoint is supported only for the *document* and *entry* resources and document text queries are only supported for the *document* resource.

5. The internal index only contains information about the _last_ `document version` for every `document`. As a result, free-text searches can only be performed in the text of the latest document version, but not for earlier document versions.

### Free-text search tips and tricks

We recommend taking the following precautions when performing free-text searches 

* Explicitly override the `documentVersions` `attribute`s to be returned in the response as the `text` attribute may unnecessarily increase the payload size significantly for documents that contain a lot of text.
* Consider making use of text highlight snippets (`highlights` returned for each resource) instead of retrieving the unabbreviated text attribute (`text`) that may be significantly larger.  
  See the model specification for more details about `highlights`.
* In order to receive any `highlights` for the attributes of a related resource, you must request that it is `expanded`. You would still get the primary results in the response even if you do not do this, but you will not receive the corresponding highlighted snippets.

Note that the API will always return the latest document version in document searches if you `expanded` the response with `documentVersions` in order to satisfy the most common use case for the search service - free-text searches in the document text.

### Advanced free-text search

By specifying the `enableAdvancedFTS` flag, certain characters will gain special meaning.

- Double quotes (") allow you to perform phrase searches for exact matches. For example: "This is my phrase search that requires an exact match"
- Asterisk (*) and question mark (?) allow you to perform wildcard searches.
  - Asterisks match zero or more consecutive characters at the beginning, middle, or end of a string. For example: \*master, Documas\*, Doc\*ter
  - Question marks match a single character at the beginning, middle, or end of a string. For example: ?ocumaster, Documaste?, Do?umaster
- Tilde (~) allows you to perform fuzzy search and proximity search.
  - When used with double-quotes ("phrase search"~3), it allows you to search for a phrase whose participating words are N words apart
  - When used with a single word (Kristian~), it allows you to search for a word with up to two edits to get a match. For example: Kristian~1 will also match Cristian, but Kristian~2 (which is equivalent to Kristian~) will also match Christian.
- Plus (+) allows you to request that a word or phrase appears in the resultset. For example: +Documaster or +"Documaster search"
- Minus (-) allows you to request that a word or phrase does not appear in the resultset. For example: -Documaster or -"Documaster search"
- Caret (^) allows you to boost a word or a phrase so that it gains a higher relevance score. For example: Documaster^1.3 or bug^0.3

## Upload endpoint

Uploads a single temporary document to Documaster as a stream.

### Request

```
POST /upload-temp HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-disposition: attachment; filename="ASCII_FILENAME"; filename*=utf-8''UTF8_FILENAME
Content-type: application/octet-stream

[Binary stream]
```

An uploaded temporary document will be removed from the server if it is not linked to a DocumentVersion resource within a specific amount of time.

The temporary document will not be available for download until it is linked to a DocumentVersion resource.

See [RFC 6266](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6266) (description of the Content-Disposition header) and [RFC 5987](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5987#section-3.2) (description of the encoding used in the filename* parameter).

The Content-Disposition header must specify at least one of the two parameters filename and filename*. When both are specified filename* takes precedence. The original charset of the filename* parameter value must be UTF-8, while the filename parameter value must be ASCII.

### Response

```
201 Created
Content-type: application/json
